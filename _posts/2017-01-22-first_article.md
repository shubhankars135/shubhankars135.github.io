title:  Implementing Linear Regression by Gradient descent(from the scratch)
---
Implementing something from the scratch , as opposed to using a established libraries to arrive at the results, is what true ML is all about - Andrej Karpathy

Keeping the above in mind, my first article in this series is about implementing something as simple as linear regression from the scratch i.e without using scikit learn (which is the most widely used library to do that). We will briefly see what linear regreesion is (although this isn't a proper introduction to linear regression, but more about how to write your own functions to do so). Lets get started.
