The vicissitude of our life never fails to amuse us. We fight against our desires, we have to make difficult career choices, we have to maintain a social circle and carry a smile when they are around. While trying to make these ends meet, we rarely get time to think about the meaning of the commonly used terminology. So almost every day of our life we get to hear the pharse 'Grow Up' in some form or the other. Firstly this term is a little paradoxical since as time passes we are all growing up, so how can someone not grow up. A little deep dive in our mordern-cultural dictionary shows that growing up refers to being more pratical and rational about the decisions and actions one makes in life, leaving our past memoirs where they are and not let them affect our present thought process and hence our personal and professional life. More concisely it means to accept the situations as they are rather than trying to change them and drawing a postive conclusion from every event of life.

So in the other words, growing up may include getting over your high school crush, choosing a career path that's more in demand and apt with the current job market, see what are the monetary benefits your hobby carries, to make friends which in someway or the other help you in getting atleast a few basic things done. They individually or when combined can be said to be the characteristics to a mordern 'grown up individual'.

Although the above points might seem higly bleak and uninspirational, they do have a silver lining with them. What is the point of continuing with a hobby which only interests you and is prosaic to others. If you are free enough to choose your freiends and acquaintances, why not choose those who'll accompany and help us in our career paths. And finally what's the point in choosing a career which does not even remotely aim at solving the issues faced by the world.
Having equally weighted the pros and cons of both the sides, we are now left with one question -Does 'to grow up' mean to stop dreaming. Although there is no universal implication of the term, we have all said this to ourselves at one point of our lives or the other - 'I need to grow up'. And this is where the need the know what exactly it means becomes extremly essential.

And we should'nt allow ourselves to be trapped in the decoding what this term precisely mean, nor should we ignore this invaluable advice which our wellwisher give us in almost every confussing stage of our life. What we need to do, is form our own defination of what it means to grow up and then - grow up.

For example, our defination of growing can be to accept that life is not a fairytale. To accept that some dreams can turn into nightmares if we don't wake ourselves up at the right time. Growing up can imply the acceptance to the fact the success is not about award reciving speeches, that destiny is not about one position which we want to reach in life, but succession of many. It might mean that becoming who you truely are is a journey of the alone to the alone, filled with unexpected realisations and frustrations. That how irrelevant our actions and motives can be in the bigger scheme of things and still clinging to them with same firmness and hope. That you are not the centre of universe and like us there are many of individuals with same thoughts and issues we face.

So growing up doesn't mean to stop dreaming, it means to dream more audaciously with open heart and open eyes.
